# RWA Platform: 4-Role Ecosystem Architecture

## üéØ Ecosystem Overview

A trust-driven, transparent, and scalable investment ecosystem combining professional validation, crowd oversight, and on-demand verification with zero registration fees.

## üë• Role Definitions

### 1. **Investor-Agents** üí∞üîç
**Who**: Every investor automatically becomes an Investor-Agent (no additional fee)
**Core Function**: Invest in projects + monitor and flag suspicious activities

```typescript
interface InvestorAgent {
  capabilities: {
    // Investment Functions
    browseProjects: boolean;
    investFunds: boolean;
    portfolioManagement: boolean;
    secondaryTrading: boolean;
    
    // Agent Functions (Automatic)
    observeProjects: boolean;
    voteOnProposals: boolean;
    flagSuspiciousActivity: boolean;
    requestVerification: boolean;
    participateInGovernance: boolean;
  };
  
  fees: {
    registrationFee: 0;
    investmentCommission: "1-3%";
    verificationRequests: "Task-based fees";
  };
  
  incentives: {
    revenueSharing: boolean;
    governanceTokens: boolean;
    reputationRewards: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Upgrade**: Every investor gets agent capabilities
- **Crowd Oversight**: Monitor investments collectively
- **Democratic Governance**: Vote on platform decisions
- **Issue Flagging**: Report suspicious activities
- **Verification Requests**: Can hire verifiers for specific checks

### 2. **Professional Agents** üèÜüìã
**Who**: Certified experts (lawyers, engineers, real estate professionals)
**Core Function**: Professional verification of legal documents, asset ownership, and project milestones

```typescript
interface ProfessionalAgent {
  requirements: {
    certification: "Professional license/qualification";
    insurance: "Professional liability coverage";
    background: "Enhanced KYC + background check";
    specialization: "Real estate | Legal | Engineering | Finance";
  };
  
  capabilities: {
    documentVerification: boolean;
    legalCompliance: boolean;
    assetOwnershipValidation: boolean;
    milestoneSupervision: boolean;
    expertReports: boolean;
    disputeResolution: boolean;
  };
  
  compensation: {
    registrationFee: 0;
    commissionBased: "2-5% of project value";
    serviceFees: "Hourly/project rates";
    bonusForAccuracy: "Performance incentives";
  };
}
```

**Specializations**:
- **Legal Agents**: Contract review, compliance verification
- **Real Estate Agents**: Property valuation, ownership verification
- **Engineering Agents**: Technical feasibility, construction oversight
- **Financial Agents**: Financial model validation, due diligence

### 3. **Verifiers** üì∏‚úÖ
**Who**: On-demand task workers (gig economy approach)
**Core Function**: Site visits, photo documentation, simple verification tasks

```typescript
interface Verifier {
  profile: {
    location: "Geographic availability";
    equipment: "Camera, GPS, basic tools";
    availability: "Part-time/full-time";
    rating: "Community-driven ratings";
  };
  
  tasks: {
    siteVisits: boolean;
    photoDocumentation: boolean;
    assetConfirmation: boolean;
    progressReports: boolean;
    simpleInspections: boolean;
  };
  
  compensation: {
    registrationFee: 0;
    taskBased: "$50-500 per verification";
    travelAllowance: "Distance-based compensation";
    bonusForSpeed: "Quick completion rewards";
  };
  
  requirements: {
    basicKYC: boolean;
    smartphone: boolean;
    reliableTransport: boolean;
    communicationSkills: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Task Types**:
- **Site Visits**: Physical presence confirmation
- **Photo Documentation**: Before/during/after project photos
- **Asset Verification**: Confirm asset existence and condition
- **Progress Monitoring**: Construction/development progress
- **Simple Inspections**: Basic safety and compliance checks

### 4. **Admin/Platform** ‚öñÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è
**Who**: Platform operators and compliance team
**Core Function**: Final oversight, compliance, dispute resolution, platform management

```typescript
interface PlatformAdmin {
  responsibilities: {
    projectApproval: boolean;
    complianceOversight: boolean;
    disputeResolution: boolean;
    escrowManagement: boolean;
    regulatoryCompliance: boolean;
    platformSecurity: boolean;
