## White-Labeled RWA Banking Partnership Platform ‚Äì Comprehensive Overview

This document captures the end‚Äëto‚Äëend vision, architecture, workflows, compliance posture, and execution plan for a white-labeled banking partnership platform enabling fractional ownership and income participation in real-world assets (RWA) through partner banks, with built-in verification agents, automated revenue distribution, and secondary liquidity.

### 1. Core Concept & Business Model
- **White-labeled RWA platform** where partner banks offer real-world asset investments to their customers
- **IIPS (Master Admin)** provides the technology platform and manages multiple partner banks
- **Partner Banks** get their own branded dashboard and customer-facing interface
- **Revenue sharing model** with commission tracking and profit distribution between IIPS and partner banks
- **Source ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Tokenize ‚Üí Invest ‚Üí Distribute ‚Üí Resell** pipeline for assets like land, real estate, trucks/vehicles, hotels, and houses

### 2. User Roles & Hierarchy

#### üèõÔ∏è Master Admin Level (IIPS Super Admin)
- **Master Admin**: Central control over all partner banks, global oversight, system management
- **IIPS Operations**: Manages platform-wide compliance, asset classes, and settlements

#### üè¶ Bank Admin Level (Partner Banks)
- **Bank Admin**: Manages their bank's operations, investors, and asset portfolio
- **Bank Operations**: Bank staff handling customer service, compliance, and day-to-day operations

#### üë• End Users (Across All Banks)
- **Investor**: Bank customers who browse assets, invest, track cashflows, and resell tokens
- **Asset Proposer**: Banks, investors, top-rate verifiers, and professional agents who submit asset proposals to Master Admin for review and approval
- **Professional Agent**: Licensed professionals (real estate agents, vehicle inspectors, etc.) who provide expert asset verification and can propose assets
- **Verification Agent**: Community contractors who inspect assets and submit reports; paid via escrow on acceptance
- **Verifiers**: Independent third-party validators who confirm asset authenticity and legal compliance

#### üéØ Asset Flow Clarification
- **Master Admin (You)**: The only entity that actually submits/adds confirmed assets to the system after review
- **Asset Proposers**: Submit asset proposals ‚Üí Master Admin ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Asset goes live on platform

  Current Status:

  ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard: Fully complete and functional
  ‚úÖ Backend APIs: Production-ready with full admin capabilitiesüü° Investor App: Good foundation but needs completion
  üî¥ Smart Contracts: Interface defined but not implemented

  Business Impact Priority:

  1. Investor App = Immediate demo/business value
  2. Smart Contracts = Technical foundation
  3. Production Deployment = Go-live readiness

  üöÄ Suggested Next Step: Complete Investor App

  - Asset Marketplace: Browse and invest in real assets
  - Portfolio Management: Track investments and returns
  - Investment Flow: Complete the investment process
  - Real-time Updates: Connect to live backend data
  - Authentication: Seamless user login/signup
  - KYC Process: User verification workflow
