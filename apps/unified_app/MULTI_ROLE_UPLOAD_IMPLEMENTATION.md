## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

This document summarizes the implementation of the multi-role asset upload system with source tracking and role-based verification requirements.

## üìã **Completed Items**

**Location**: Multiple files and architecture

**Features Implemented:**
- **Super Admin Upload**: Direct upload with bypass verification option
- **Bank Admin Upload**: Enhanced existing flow with source tracking
- **Professional Agent Upload**: Credential verification and client representation
- **Individual User Upload**: KYC validation and ownership verification

**Features Implemented:**
- **Role-specific requirements**: Different document and verification needs per role
- **Upload limits**: File size, asset count, and format restrictions per role
- **Verification workflows**: KYC, professional credentials, bank authorization
- **Permission-based access**: Role-specific feature availability

### ‚úÖ Item 18: Source Tracking in Assets Database Schema
**Location**: `lib/models/asset.dart`

**Features Implemented:**
- **AssetSource enum**: Tracks upload source (super_admin, bank_admin, professional_agent, individual, platform)
- **AssetUploadMetadata class**: Complete metadata tracking for each upload
- **Enhanced Asset model**: Includes uploadMetadata, version tracking, and audit trail
- **Source-based properties**: Helper methods for institutional/individual classification

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### Core Components

#### 1. **Enhanced Asset Model** (`lib/models/asset.dart`)
```dart
class Asset {
  // ... existing properties
  final AssetUploadMetadata? uploadMetadata;
  final DateTime? lastModified;
  final String? modifiedBy;
  final int version;

  // Source tracking helpers
  bool get isInstitutional;
  bool get isProfessionalManaged;
  bool get isIndividualOwned;
  String get sourceDisplayName;
  String get sourceColorCode;
  bool get requiresEnhancedVerification;
}
```

#### 2. **Upload Metadata Tracking**
```dart
class AssetUploadMetadata {
  final AssetSource source;
  final String uploaderId;
  final String? uploaderName;
  final String? uploaderEmail;
  final String? bankId;
  final String? professionalLicenseNumber;
  final DateTime uploadedAt;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? customMetadata;
  final List<String> verificationDocuments;
  final bool requiresKYC;
  final bool requiresProfessionalVerification;
}
```

#### 3. **Role-based Upload Service** (`lib/services/asset_upload_service.dart`)
```dart
class AssetUploadService {
  static UploadRequirements getUploadRequirements(UserRole userRole);
  static Widget getUploadScreen(UserRole userRole);
  static AssetUploadMetadata createUploadMetadata(...);
  static List<String> validateUpload(...);
}
```

### Upload Flows Implemented

#### 1. **Super Admin Upload** (`lib/features/asset_upload/super_admin_upload_screen.dart`)
- **Privileges**: Bypass verification, platform asset marking
- **Features**: 5-tab interface (Details, Media, Location, Admin, Documents)
- **Capabilities**: 500MB file limit, 100 assets per upload, bulk upload
- **Admin Controls**: Verification bypass toggle, platform ownership marking

#### 2. **Individual User Upload** (`lib/features/asset_upload/individual_upload_screen.dart`)
- **KYC Required**: BVN, NIN, personal documents verification
- **Features**: 5-tab interface (KYC, Details, Ownership, Media, Documents)
- **Validation**: Identity verification before upload allowed
- **Limitations**: 50MB file limit, 3 assets max, manual approval required

#### 3. **Bank Admin Upload** (Enhanced existing `new_asset_proposal_screen.dart`)
- **Requirements**: Bank authorization, corporate KYC
- **Features**: Institutional-level verification
- **Capabilities**: 200MB file limit, 50 assets per upload
- **Documents**: Asset title, valuation report, legal compliance certificates

#### 4. **Upload Type Selection** (`lib/features/asset_upload/asset_upload_selection_screen.dart`)
- **Role Detection**: Automatic role-based flow routing
- **Requirements Display**: Shows role-specific upload requirements
- **Feature Overview**: Upload limits, verification needs, document requirements

## üîê **Security & Verification Features**

### Role-based Requirements Matrix

| Role | KYC Required | Professional Verification | File Size Limit | Max Assets | Bulk Upload | Manual Approval |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Super Admin | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | 500MB | 100 | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Bank Admin | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | 200MB | 50 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Professional Agent | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100MB | 10 | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Individual | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | 50MB | 3 | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Verifier | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | 25MB | 1 | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### Document Requirements by Role

**Super Admin:**
- Optional: Asset Documentation, Valuation Report, Legal Documents

**Bank Admin:**
- Required: Asset Title/Deed, Bank Authorization, Valuation Report, Legal Compliance Certificate
- Optional: Insurance Certificate, Tax Assessment, Property Management Agreement

**Professional Agent:**

## üé® **UI/UX Features**

## üîÑ **Integration Points**

### Database Schema Extensions
The Asset model now includes complete source tracking:
- `uploadMetadata` - Complete upload source information
- `lastModified` - Audit trail for modifications
- `modifiedBy` - User tracking for changes
- `version` - Version control for asset updates

### API Extensions Required
- Upload endpoints need to handle `AssetUploadMetadata`
- Validation endpoints for role-specific requirements
- KYC verification integration
- Document storage and retrieval
- Audit logging for compliance

## üöÄ **Usage Example**

```dart
// Navigate to role-appropriate upload flow
AssetUploadRouter.navigateToUpload(context, UserRole.investorAgent);

// Create upload metadata with source tracking
final metadata = AssetUploadService.createUploadMetadata(
  userRole: UserRole.individualUser,
  uploaderId: 'user_123',
  uploaderName: 'John Doe',
  customMetadata: {'kycCompleted': true},
);

// Validate upload meets requirements
final errors = AssetUploadService.validateUpload(
  userRole: UserRole.individualUser,
  assetData: assetData,
  uploadedDocuments: documents,
  fileSizeInMB: totalSize,
);
```
